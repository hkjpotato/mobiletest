## Installation and Development

1. `npm install` -- install node dependencies

  1. On Windows, this may throw some warnings.  Running `npm intall` a second time often fixes everything.

2. `npm run hot-server` -- start server with hot reloading React components

3. Go to http://localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure you're on the right version of node: 5.1.1  Install nvm if you need to have different versions of node for different projects.

2. Clean out your node_modules:

  1. `git clean -dfx`
  
  2. `npm install` (may need to run more than once)
